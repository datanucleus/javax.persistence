Clean definition of JPA API intended for use with DataNucleus JPA since the JCP haven't provided an official JPA API jar.
See http://java.net/projects/jpa-spec/downloads for the specification used to generate this API.
Note that this DataNucleus JPA API jar has some bug fixes and improvements not present in "standard" JPA.
